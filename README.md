# 🎧 Music Preferences in Springfield and Shelbyville

## 📌 Goal

Test three hypotheses based on user behavior data from Yandex.Music:

1. User activity differs depending on the day of the week and the city.
2. On Monday mornings and Friday evenings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville prefer different genres.
3. In Springfield, users prefer pop, while in Shelbyville they listen to rap more.

## 📁 Files

- `basic_python_project.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with all the code and analysis
- `music_project_en.csv` — anonymized log of user activity (city, time, genre, etc.)

## 🔍 Tools Used

- Python
- pandas

## 🧹 Project Steps

1. **Data overview** – examined structure and potential issues.
2. **Preprocessing** – handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting.
3. **Hypothesis testing** – used filtering, grouping, and basic comparisons.

## ✅ Key Findings

- **Hypothesis 1**: ✅ **Confirmed** — user activity varies by day and city.
- **Hypothesis 2**: ❌ **Rejected** — no clear genre differences at specific times.
- **Hypothesis 3**: ❌ **Rejected** — pop is popular in both cities.

**Note**: This is a basic project focused on practicing Python and pandas. The hypothesis  and comments' structure were included.
